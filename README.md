# Important: Do you know what palindromes are?

If you did not (until now), I did, either.
But thanks an entry level job test, I discovered it and transformed a little test in a HTML, CSS and mainly Javascript project!

It's very simple to get used to...

# How it works?

Type the number you wish to see the palindromes (and remembers, most of those words don't exist!), and after that, see the magic happens!

# The logic

The logic behind this is about piles. The first to enter is the last to get out. And the expression was done as easy as possible.
To get that, some tasks are required: I chose there a palindrome between 3 and 5 characters, randomly with JS, and a word is made from that (see code for further details).

Enjoy it!
